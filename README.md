The assignment is to build a simple command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer. 

One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, each representing each letter of the word. In most variants, proper nouns, such as names, places and brands, are not allowed. Slang words, sometimes referred to as informal or shortened words, are also not allowed. If a guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.
